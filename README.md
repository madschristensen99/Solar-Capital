# Solar Capital

Solar Capital is a project in development. The idea is to create a game which can simulate the process of developing a lunar colony on the Lunar South Pole. Mechanics of the game include the manufacturing of solar panels using lunar rocks to mine Monero to further funding for the colony, eventual human colinzation, and the end goal of reaching a black hole at the edge of the solar system utlizing a mass driver.
